### Background
The purpose of this project is to generate tables and figures for the technical report of the clinical study on mice that were identify with SCC tumor. In this study, 248 mice (after removing the duplicate) that received treatment with range of drug regimens over the course of 45 days and their tumor development was observed and measured during this time period. We’ll compare the performance of drug named Capomulin against the other drug regimens on this study.

### Analysis
There are 10 drug regimens in this study. Out of the 248 mice, there are 51% male mice and 49% female mice; and 230 mice were treated with Capomulin, and 178 mice were treated with Propriva. Capomulin treatment represents the maximum number of treatments for the drug regimens while the Propriva trements represents the minimum number of treatments for the drug regimens.

The box plot compares the result of the final tumor volume among 4 drug regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, and it shows that the final tumor volumes of mice that were treated by Capomulin and Ramicane are less than those that were treated with Infubinol and Ceftamin. The result is also confirmed by the summary statistic table where it shows the mean of the tumor volume among the 10 drug regimens in this study. According to the statistic table, the mean of the tumor volume of Campomulin and Remican are at the lowest comparing to the mean of the tumor volume from other drug regimens.

In this study, we picked mouse id # l509 to observe the development of tumor volume over the period of 45 days that it was treated with Campomulin. The line chart shows that the tumor volume decreased significantly over the period of time. However, more samples are need to be picked in order to conclude that Campomulin is effective in reducing the size of the tumor.

The scatter plot shows that the correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume is 0.84. It means that there is a positive correlation between these 2 factors  as the weight of mice increase, the tumor size increase.
